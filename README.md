# Real-Time Data Engineering Pipeline 🚀

End-to-end pipeline built with:
- Kafka for real-time ingestion
- Spark Structured Streaming for processing
- Delta Lake for storage
- Apache Airflow for orchestration
- Trino for querying data lake
- dbt for data modeling
- Docker for local development

## 💡 Pipeline Flow

1. 🔄 Kafka Producer generates fake clickstream events
2. ⚡ Spark reads from Kafka and transforms data
3. 🧊 Data is written as Parquet/Delta files
4. 📅 Airflow orchestrates and schedules jobs
5. 🔍 Trino & dbt used for analytics and modeling

## 📦 Stack

| Component | Tool |
|----------|------|
| Ingestion | Kafka |
| Processing | Spark Structured Streaming |
| Storage | Delta Lake / Parquet |
| Orchestration | Apache Airflow |
| Query Layer | Trino |
| Modeling | dbt |
| Deployment | Docker Compose |

## 📂 Structure

- `kafka/`: producer & data simulator
- `spark/`: real-time processor
- `airflow/`: DAGs and workflows
- `lake/`: output datasets
- `trino/`: SQL queries
- `dbt/`: data models
- `notebooks/`: exploration & validation
